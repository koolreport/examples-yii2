The above example shows you how to create `LineChart` using ChartJs package. In this example, for purpose of chart demonstration only, we do use mock-up data from array. As you can see, the KoolReport's widget in general support dataSource could be DataStore, Process, DataSource or even simple array.

This example shows how to build a line chart with multiline labels.

For example:

    labels = [['June', '2015'], 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December', ['January', '2016'], 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May']
