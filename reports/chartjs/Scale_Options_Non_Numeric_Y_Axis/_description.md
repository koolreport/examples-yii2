The above example shows you how to create `LineChart` using ChartJs package. In this example, for purpose of chart demonstration only, we do use mock-up data from array.

This example shows how to build a line chart with non numeric Y axis.

    yLabels = ['', 'Request Added', 'Request Viewed', 'Request Accepted', 'Request Solved', 'Solving Confirmed'],
